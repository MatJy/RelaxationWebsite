              <p>
                Sitting all day, being stressed and not doing anything can make
                your muscles tight and tense. This exercise will help you with
                that.
              </p>
              <h4>What to do?</h4>
              <ol>
                <h4>Arms</h4>
                <li>Lie down and close your eyes or stare at the ceiling</li>
                <li>
                  Put your hands into a position like you would hug yourself
                </li>
                <li>Open them widely laying your hands on the floor</li>
                <li>
                  Repeat this as many times you want and then move to legs part
                </li>
              </ol>
              <ol>
                <h4>Legs</h4>
                <li>Lie down and close your eyes or stare at the ceiling</li>
                <li>straigthen your legs as much as possible</li>
                <li>bring your legs closer to your body like you would walk</li>
                <li>
                  wait for ten seconds and then bring them back to starting
                  position
                </li>
                <li>Repeat until you feel the tensity leave from your legs</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
              <h2 class="display-6">Draw calming circles</h2>
              <p>Colours, movement and creativity can help you feel relaxed by stimulating your senses
                and giving you an outlet and focus for your emotions
              </p>
              <h4>What to do?</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Take pen and paper</li>
                <li>
                  Go sit somewhere comfortable with your shoulders relaxed
                </li>
                <li>Now draw a cirle, as big as possible</li>
                <li>Keep drawing circles and try not to let your pencil leave the paper</li>
                <li>Take time to focus on what you're drawing. Focusing on these sensations can help you quieten your mind.</li>
              </ol>
              <p> If you find this exercise not working, try using a colouring book. 
                There you can just color the different shapes using as many colours as you can. 
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
              <h2 class="display-6"> Moment in nature</h2>
              <p>In this exercise you will experience your surroundings in a new way and also get some movement to your body. If you want to
                you can strech your muscles a bit in the nature.
              </p>
              <h4>What to do?</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Find some green space and when you are there just stop and feel the surroundings.</li>
                <li>
                  Now start exploring and look at the things around you. What do you see, smell and hear.
                </li>
                <li>How does everything feel, is it soft, hard or what? </li>
                <li>What sounds do you hear. Are there birds, does the wind pass through your ears or the leaves crunching as you walk</li>
              </ol>
              <p> For a variation if you don't have any green space close to you, try to open your window and then notice the things what you see and hear</p>
