            Hello! <br />
            My information: Matias Jylh√§ - AD1414 - HTK23<br />
            I have created this website because I want everyone to relax once a
            while and get the stress out of ones mind
          </p>
          <h5>Documentation</h5>
          <p>
            I have tested this website on google chrome (version 119.0.6045.16),
            Microsoft edge (Version 119.0.2151.72) and Mozilla firefox (Version
            120.0). I desinged this website and how it would look like by
            myself, but there are codes that i have taken inspiration from to
            create this site. Some codes needed changes to adjust my site and
            others I have just wrote how it was presented on the tutorial.

            Most of the pictures I have used are from pexels, a website of free
            photos. The other that I haven't taken from there are all creative
            commons licensed. For the hamburger menu I had to ask help from
            chatGPT, and made some little changes to it by myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            And because I'm not an expert of this topic I have taken some of the
            tips and exercises from this site called "mind". There were very
            good relaxation guides that I would also recommmend, so that's why I
            took some of the stuff from there. I couldn't have made any good
            guides by myself. On some of the exercises I made some of my own
            changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used bootstrap on the "Exercises" page to test some CSS framework.
            It was quite easy to use but it took time to learn how to use it. I
            did most of the page with it, though needed help with using it for
            example I couldn't create the hamburger menu with bootsrap all by
            myself.
